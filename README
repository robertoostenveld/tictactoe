# tictactoe

Simple implementation of the traditional Tic Tac Toe (XO) game in
MATLAB with a graphical user interface

See https://nl.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/36696-tic-tac-toe-xo-game
for the original implementation. This version of the code only has some
reorganization of the functions in separate files, some reformatting of the
whitespace around the code, and some additional help sections in the code. All
credits go to Husam Bilal for implementing and sharing this.
